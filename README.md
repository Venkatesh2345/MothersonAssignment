## Overcoming Challenges with Ingenuity

A notable challenge was the absence of a direct input mechanism for image URLs in the design file. The solution? I devised a method by maintaining a curated list of image URLs. Dynamically generating a random image from this list was achieved through the adept use of Math.random() and Math.floor() functions, ensuring a visually dynamic display.
